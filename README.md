# Background
Driven by a desire to become more proficient in SQL and navigate the data science job market more effectively. My goal was to pinpoint the most lucrative and in-demand skills for Data Analysts.

The data for this project comes from [Luke Barousse's SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql). It's packed with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

# Tools I Used
To deep dive into the data analyst job market, I used several key tools:
- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to editor for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis.

# The Analysis
Each query in this project aimed at answering specific questions about the data analyst job market:

1. **Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs:** Identified the top 10 highest-paying Data Analyst roles that are available remotely.
2. **Skills for Top Paying Jobs:** Figured out what skills are required for these top-paying roles, helping understand the high-salary tech stack.
3. **In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts:** Determined which skills are most frequently requested in job postings.
4. **Skills Based on Salary:** Explored which skills are associated with the highest average salaries.
5. **Optimal Skills to Learn:** Combined demand and salary data to find the most "optimal" skills for career growth.

# What I Learned
Through this project, I've significantly enhanced my SQL toolkit:
- 🧩 **Complex Query Crafting:** Mastered advanced joins and consolidated data from multiple tables.
- 📊 **Data Aggregation:** Got cozy with `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions like `COUNT()` and `AVG()`.
- 💡 **Analytical Thinking:** Learned how to turn raw data into meaningful insights for job seekers.

# Conclusions
This project provided a clear roadmap for anyone looking to enter the data analysis field. It highlights that technical skills like **SQL** and **Python** are not just in high demand but are also linked to some of the best-paying opportunities in the industry.
